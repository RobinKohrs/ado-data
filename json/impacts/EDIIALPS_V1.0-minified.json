Among the altitudinal records, the colline chronologies showed highest correlation with June precipitation and drought indicator data. In particular, species-specific differences affected the significance level of drought response, with decreasing drought sensitivity towards higher elevations.

In Schorer (1992) a case study of the City of Berne is presented as a typical example of large communal water supply system. In 1947 water supply was based mainly on several springs and groundwater wells in the Valley of the Emme River. Decreasing inflow and rising demand stressed the water supply system to its limits. Due to the lack of precipitation the inflow to the system from the springs decreased sharply from April onwards. The supply from the groundwater wells had been stable until in autumn, when the Emmentalsystem for the very first time was not capable to supply the usual amount of m³/d anymore. Already in pre-summer public wells/fountains were shut off to save water. Yet this measure wasn't sufficient to compensate for the deficit, and in the height of summer a hosepipe ban had to be imposed, forbidding sprinkling of streets and squares, parks and gardens. There were announcements in the Stadtanzeiger (municipality news) and in the local newspaper, finally even sound-trucks were used to appeal to the citizens to save water. In addition, an abandoned water source was reactivated during the drought and all available water resources from neighbour communities were used.

In Schorer (1992) a case study of the City of Berne is presented as a typical example of large communal water supply system. In 1947 water supply was based mainly on several springs and groundwater wells in the Valley of the Emme River. Decreasing inflow and rising demand stressed the water supply system to its limits. Due to the lack of precipitation the inflow to the system from the springs decreased sharply from April onwards. The supply from the groundwater wells had been stable until in autumn, when the Emmentalsystem for the very first time was not capable to supply the usual amount of m³/d anymore. Already in pre-summer public wells/fountains were shut off to save water. Yet this measure wasn't sufficient to compensate for the deficit, and in the height of summer a hosepipe ban had to be imposed, forbidding sprinkling of streets and squares, parks and gardens.

Besides the low yields the potatoes were of very small size, thus the minimum size of table potatoes was exceptionally reduced for the relief of the farmers. Particularly severely affected were seed potatoes due to higher damage by vine fretter being also an indirect consequence of the drought conditions in 1976. Due to the drought losses there was a lack of seed potatoes for 1977, which could not be covered by imports from other European countries, because prices were increased to five-fold values because of the drought. Thus the farmers were forced to use low quality seeds which then led to exceptional low yields in the seed potatoes production and the need for huge imports of seeds in 1977.","Information_Source":11},{"ID":456,"non-unique-ID":4392,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"Summer","Month_start":"","Year_end":"","Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"DE","NUTS1_ID":"DE2","NUTS2_ID":"DE27","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":1,"Impact_subtype":1.7,"Impact_description":"A second hay harvest in \"Schwaben\" wasn't possible due to the drought.","Information_Source":14},{"ID":457,"non-unique-ID":4568,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"FR","NUTS1_ID":"FRC","NUTS2_ID":"FRC2","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":2,"Impact_subtype":2.1,"Impact_description":"Young Trees (under one year old)  alomst 100% died.","Information_Source":2},{"ID":458,"non-unique-ID":4569,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"FR","NUTS1_ID":"FRC","NUTS2_ID":"FRC2","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":2,"Impact_subtype":2.2,"Impact_description":"Young Trees (under one year old)  alomst 100% died.","Information_Source":2},{"ID":459,"non-unique-ID":4570,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"FR","NUTS1_ID":"FRC","NUTS2_ID":"FRC2","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":2,"Impact_subtype":2.3,"Impact_description":"Young Trees (under one year old)  alomst 100% died.","Information_Source":2},{"ID":460,"non-unique-ID":4571,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"FR","NUTS1_ID":"FRC","NUTS2_ID":"FRC2","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":2,"Impact_subtype":2.5,"Impact_description":"Young Trees (under one year old)  alomst 100% died.","Information_Source":2},{"ID":461,"non-unique-ID":4572,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"FR","NUTS1_ID":"FRC","NUTS2_ID":"FRC2","NUTS3_ID":"","Impact_category":2,"Impact_subtype":2.6,"Impact_description":"Young Trees (under one year old)  alomst 100% died.","Information_Source":2},{"ID":462,"non-unique-ID":5376,"Year_start":1976,"Season_start":"Summer","Month_start":"","Year_end":1976,"Season_end":"","Month_end":"","Country":"CH","NUTS1_ID":"CH0","NUTS2_ID":"CH02","NUTS3_ID":"CH022","Impact_category":1,"Impact_subtype":1.1,"Impact_description":"In 1976 the grain yields in  Central and Eastern parts of Switzerland were even on an above average level, whereas in Western Switzerland severe precipitation deficits from March until June adversely affected especially summer wheat.

Among the altitudinal records, the colline chronologies showed highest correlation with June precipitation and drought indicator data. In particular, species-specific differences affected the significance level of drought response, with decreasing drought sensitivity towards higher elevations.

So the gauging station in Cologne measured the lowest level on the 10th of May in 90 years. On the 30th of May the Kaub gauging station still only showed levels of about 90 cm, with 80 being the ultimate limit for transportation on the upper Rhine. Therefore the inland waterway transportation companies that are located in Kehl had to reduce the amount of freight per cargo ship, so they only carried 30 to 50% of the approved load (e.g. 700 compared to 2000 tons per ship) and therefore had to run into port more often, while as well more ships were needed. Thus they had a threefold fuel consumption.
