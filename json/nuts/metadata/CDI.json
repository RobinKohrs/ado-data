{"short_name":"CDI","long_name":"Combined Drought Index","abstract":"The Combined Drought Index (CDI) is used to identify areas affected by agricultural drought. It was developed by Sepulcre-Canto et al. (2012) and is based on the SPI, SMA, and VHI indices. Areas are classified according to three primary drought classes: (1) 'Watch', indicating that precipitation is less than normal; (2) 'Warning', indicating that soil moisture is in deficit; and (3) 'Alert', indicating that vegetation shows signs of stress. Two additional classes - 'Partia recovery' and 'Recovery' - identify stages of the vegetation recovery process.","colormap":{"id":"data","type":"fill","paint":{"fill-color":{"property":"value","stops":[[0,"rgba(255,255,255,0.7)"],[1,"rgba(244,241,17,0.7)"],[2,"rgba(253,117,0,0.7)"],[3,"rgba(255,14,14,0.7)"],[4,"rgba(178,55,2,0.7)"],[5,"rgba(149,236,149,0.7)"]]},"fill-opacity":["case",["==",["get","value"],null],0,1]},"legend":{"stops":[[0,"Normal","rgba(255,255,255,0.7)"],[1,"Watch","rgba(244,241,17,0.7)"],[2,"Warning","rgba(253,117,0,0.7)"],[3,"Alert","rgba(255,14,14,0.7)"],[4,"Partial recovery","rgba(178,55,2,0.7)"],[5,"Full recovery","rgba(149,236,149,0.7)"]]}}}
