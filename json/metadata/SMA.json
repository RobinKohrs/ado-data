    "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA) index is used for determining the start and duration of agricultural drought conditions, which arise when soil moisture availability to plants drops to such a level that it adversely affects crop yield, and hence, agricultural production. The SMA index is computed based on soil moisture anomalies from the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2022)",
