    "abstract": "The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) illustrates the severity of drought based on the vegetation health and the influence of temperature on plant conditions. The VHI is a composite index, it combines both the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI). The TCI is calculated using a similar equation to the VCI, but relates the current temperature to the long-term maximum and minimum. A decrease in the VHI would, for example, indicate relatively poor vegetation conditions and warmer temperatures, signifying stressed vegetation conditions, and over a longer period would be indicative of drought.",
