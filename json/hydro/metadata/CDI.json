    "abstract": "The Combined Drought Index (CDI) is used to identify areas affected by agricultural drought. It was developed by Sepulcre-Canto et al. (2012) and is based on the SPI, SMA, and VHI indices. Areas are classified according to three primary drought classes: (1) 'Watch', indicating that precipitation is less than normal; (2) 'Warning', indicating that soil moisture is in deficit; and (3) 'Alert', indicating that vegetation shows signs of stress. Two additional classes - 'Partia recovery' and 'Recovery' - identify stages of the vegetation recovery process.",
